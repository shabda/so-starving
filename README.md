This is a set of apps which creates the same application in various 
Python web micro-frameworks. 

The app(s) talks to Facebook, and finds out recent people
who have posted a public status with the text "so starving".

This idea came from reading [Onion](http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-am-so-starving-vs-i-am-so-starving,11541/).

We have the same app in these frameworks.
